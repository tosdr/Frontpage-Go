# ToS;DR Classifications
ToS;DR aims at creating a transparent and peer-reviewed process to rate and analyse Terms of Service and Privacy Policies in order to create a rating from Grade A to Grade E.

--- 

Terms of service are reviewed by contributors and divided into small points that we can discuss, compare and ultimately assign a score with a badge:

(`Good`), (`Bad`), (`Blocker`) or (`Neutral`)
Once a service has enough badges to assess the fairness of their terms for users, a class is assigned automatically by pondering the average scores. 

-  (`Grade A`) are the best terms of services: they treat you fairly, respect your rights and will not abuse your data.

- (`Grade B`) The terms of services are fair towards the user but they could be improved.

- (`Grade C`) The terms of service are okay but some issues need your consideration.

- (`Grade D`) The terms of service are very uneven or there are some important issues that need your attention.

- (`Grade E`) The terms of service raise very serious concerns.

- (`No Grade Yet`) Not enough information exists to accurately grade this service yet.

Right now, you will notice that not many services have a class assigned. That is because we need more data and more reviews before we can start assigning them. Moreover, we are still experimenting with how to apply classes.
