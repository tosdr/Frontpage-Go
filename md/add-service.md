# Adding new Services

We appreciate that you want to contribute to ToS;DR by adding new services. However, we have decided to temporarily restrict the ability to add services behind Phoenix [(edit.tosdr.org)](https://edit.tosdr.org), which requires an account. This decision was made to reduce the amount of spam and to simplify our stack.

Please note that the option to request adding a service may come back in the future. We value your contributions and thank you for your understanding.
