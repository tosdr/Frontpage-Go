# ToS;DR Go Frontpage
A new experience for ToS;DR, written in Go.

# WIP
This is an actively developed project and we are working hard at bringing it up to speed to the normal Frontpage, however, some 404s, broken links, etc. are to be expected for a while. Thank you for your understanding!

# Running
Either run it with Docker, or install Go, set the config to point to the API server (you can get a `settings.yaml` from a team member), and `go run main.go` it!
